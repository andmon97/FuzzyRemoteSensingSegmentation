# Fuzzy Rules for Remotely Sensed Images Segmentation

Segmentation of remotely sensed images is a complicated task because the images do not depict well-defined objects.
To overcome this problem, fuzzy logic is really useful as it allows to classify these objects with a degree of uncertainty. 

In particular, an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), is useful for extracting fuzzy rules for pixel classification of images. 
We use this approach for segmenting remotely sensed images into four different classes: Building, Road, Vegetation and Water.

This work is part of the Computer Vision exam at University of Bari "Aldo Moro".
